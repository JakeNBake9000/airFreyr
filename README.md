## Contributing

First off, I am in no way a programmer. I'm a groundskeeper who wanted to use his old iPod again. This is the product of a couple of weekends spent on StackOverflow to try to stick something together with tape and glue to download music that I have on CD, but I no longer have a CD drive to rip.

Feel free to make any changes you'd like! I've found that the search algorithm is unreliable in certain edge cases and tends to give music videos more often than it will give audio-only tracks. I am currently working on this. 

I did optimize this code with Claude Sonnet 4 after I got the first version working. The Sonnet-enhanced version (this repository) contains a much cleaner code and is easier for beginners to make their own changes to (Not that it would be any different for a more seasoned programmer to read or edit). If that's not your style and you prefer to see what I scrawled out in my IDE with very minimal documentation and less readability, go ahead. That repository is available at [zogdog9000/airFreyrClassic](https://lolwut.com) and WILL NOT be maintained. 

Thanks for taking the time to check out a lil' project by a crazy midwesterner. I hope you'll love breathing new life into your iPods like I did! Props to [miraclx for freyr-js, the inspiration / cause for this project!](https://github.com/miraclx/freyr-js)
